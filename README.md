A project to learn about 3D design while giving my DIY keyboard a less DIY look...

The idea is to have a 3D printed case for my Corne Keyboard, made my own version of it including on/off switch, smd reset button and some other features (will link it in the future). The top part of the case includes the "top plate" and MCU cover, this keyboard has no oled screen (at least for now), itÂ´s assembled using threaded inserts and m2 screws, has internal spacer so the pcb is resting over enough material for it not to flex while typng

First approach to something looking like what I've thinking of for some time.
