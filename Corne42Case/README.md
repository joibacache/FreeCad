## Case for Corne Keyboard ##
> *Work In Progress*

My tweaked version of Foostan's CherryMX with added On/Off switch, pads for soldering your battery and smd reset switch.

First time creating a 3d model from scratch, the idea is to create a more product looking keyboard instead of a DIY project.

More information soon.

v0.2
Created hole to access on/off switch and reset button
Created hole for usbc port access
Fixed thumbcluster alignment
