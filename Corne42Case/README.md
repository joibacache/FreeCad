## Case for Corne Keyboard ##
> Work In Progress

My tweaked version of Foostan's CherryMX with added On/Off switch, pads for soldering your battery and smd reset switch.

First time creating a 3d model from scratch, the idea is to create a more product looking keyboard instead of a DIY project.

More information soon.
