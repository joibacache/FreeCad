## Case for Corne Keyboard ##
> *Work In Progress*

My tweaked version of Foostan's CherryMX with added On/Off switch, pads for soldering your battery and smd reset switch.

First time creating a 3d model from scratch, the idea is to create a more product looking keyboard instead of a DIY project.

More information soon.

##### v0.2
* Created hole to access on/off switch and reset button
* Created hole for usbc port access
* Fixed thumbcluster alignment

##### v0.3
* Created a small pocket on bottom half to fit a 500mah 603030 lithium battery
* Reduced the overall case height for writst comfort improvement
